Beware, O my brother, of showiness in words and actions, for it is, in itself, a form of polytheism. Guard against self-deception, for an action mixed with it does not ascend to Allah. Do not accept your religion from anyone except those who fear for their religion. For he who does not fear for his religion is like a sick person who cannot cure himself or wish good for himself, for how can someone who does not fear for himself be concerned about your religion, O my brother? Truly, your religion is your flesh and blood. Mourn for your soul and have mercy on it, for if you do not show it mercy, you will not be shown mercy. Associate only with those who instill indifference to this world and lead you toward the Hereafter. Beware of sitting with lovers of this world, for they indulge in discussions of this world, and they will corrupt your heart and your religion.",

After that, O my brother, hold fast to piety and good character. Do not contradict the Muslim community (Al-Jama'ah), for goodness lies within it. But do not be with those who are preoccupied with this world and immersed in it, for they are like those who build by destroying another. Give guidance to every Muslim when they ask you about matters of religion. Do not withhold sincere advice when someone seeks counsel from you regarding what pleases Allah. Beware of betraying a fellow Muslim, for he who betrays a Muslim is like one who betrays Allah and His Messenger. If you love your brother for the sake of Allah, do not spare yourself or your wealth for him. Avoid disputes, arguments, and debates, for all of these will make you unjust, treacherous, and sinful. Practice patience in all situations, for indeed, patience leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. Beware of anger and malice, for they lead to sinfulness, and sinfulness leads to the Fire.",

Leave aside what causes you doubt and perform what you are certain about, and you will be in a state of well-being. Push away doubt with certainty, and your religion will be preserved. Call to what is approved and forbid what is disapproved, and you will become a beloved of Allah. Despise the wicked, and you will drive away the devils. Express less joy and elation over what you gain from the worldly life, and your greatness in the sight of Allah will increase.",

Do not be careless about them, for you are not neglected, and you will be held accountable for all of this on the Day of Resurrection. If you desire to engage in worldly matters, beware of haste. If you see that an action will benefit you in the Hereafter, proceed with it; otherwise, refrain until you observe how someone else performs it and how they fare. Seek prosperity from Allah. Once you decide to embark on a deed from the deeds of the Hereafter, hasten towards it before Satan blocks your path to it.",
