Beware, O my brother, of ostentation in words and deeds, for this in itself is polytheism. Beware of self-delusion, because the act with which it is mixed does not elevate (to Allah). Do not accept your religion from anyone except one who fears for his religion. After all, someone who is not afraid for his religion is like a sick person who cannot cure himself and wish good for himself, how will he be able to cure other people and wish good for them?! How can anyone worry about your religion who is not afraid for himself? O my brother, verily your religion is your flesh and blood. Mourn for your soul and have mercy on it, because if you do not show mercy to it, you will not receive mercy. Be only with those who instill in you indifference to this world and direct you to the Last Life. And beware of sitting with lovers of this world who delve into discussions of this world, because they will corrupt your heart and your religion.",

After that, O my brother, hold fast to piety and good character. Do not contradict the Muslim community (Al-Jama'ah), for goodness lies within it. But do not be with those who are preoccupied with this world and immersed in it, for they are like those who build by destroying another. Give guidance to every Muslim when they ask you about matters of religion. Do not withhold sincere advice when someone seeks counsel from you regarding what pleases Allah. Beware of betraying a fellow Muslim, for he who betrays a Muslim is like one who betrays Allah and His Messenger. If you love your brother for the sake of Allah, do not spare yourself or your wealth for him. Avoid disputes, arguments, and debates, for all of these will make you unjust, treacherous, and sinful. Practice patience in all situations, for indeed, patience leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. Beware of anger and malice, for they lead to sinfulness, and sinfulness leads to the Fire.",
